% Grinnemo and Br\"unstrom (2002) present PRTP, a TCP-based partially reliable protocol for soft real-time flows (e.g. video). PRTP lets applications trade some TCP reliability for better throughput and lower jitter, but the study notes PRTP is not TCP-friendly and best for error-prone wireless links.

% Rajiullah (2012) analyzes PR-SCTP (the partial-reliability extension of SCTP). He explains that PR-SCTP allows per-message (per-chunk) reliability control via the Forward-TSN mechanism, letting applications skip or mark messages as non-critical to meet timeliness requirements.
